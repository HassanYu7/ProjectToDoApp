# Project To Do App


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This project is for me personally to learn and introduce some improvements and modifications to the project,
in addition to that in a special repository, no one can see it except me, 
so I would like to make it a practical application for understanding git and github as well and anchoring the concepts.
